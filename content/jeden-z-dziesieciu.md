Summary: The video from my appearance in 'Jeden z Dziesięciu' - Polish quiz show

I didn't plan to write anything about things unrelated to programming and my coding projects, but now I've changed my mind. Even if it's just in order to keep track of things I did in the past, then I think it may be beneficial ;) I'll write only about the most important things, anyway.

The first 'private' post is about my appearance in a TV quiz show produced by the polish public television.

# The rules of the show

'Jeden z Dziesięciu', based on the British 'Fifteen to One' format, is the interesting quiz show I'm watching (with varying frequency) at least since year 2000.

In the beginning there are ten participants who need to answer the questions. Every player can make at most two mistakes.  
Players, after a correct answer, choose who should be asked next. This phase continues until just three players remain in the game. They take part in the final.  
It is pretty similar to the previous phase: After a few free-for-all questions, the first player who correctly answers for three questions can select who will answer next. It is happening until the only one player remains or they run out of questions. The questions can fall in one of about 100 categories, so one may be asked for almost anything, like history, geography, chemistry, actors, sport, foreign languages (especially Latin :) )... It's also possible to ask for a question for yourself to gain more points, but they matter only if you win and want to take part in the (monthly) grand final.

# Back to the story

Of course when I was a child I didn't know the answer for most of the questions, but the enormous knowledge presented by the contestants has always fascinated me and motivated to learn and study. So, after years of watching it, I've decided to give it a try and apply to eliminations which were hosted in my city in November 2017. I've expected to meet just a few people, but I was pretty surprised to see a line of more than a hundred of wannabe-participants waiting in front of the building. The eliminations went pretty well (I've answered for 19 of 20 easy questions) and I was invited to Lublin (where the quiz is recorded) on 16th of February.

I was a bit stressed in the beginning and I was pretty unsure about most of my answers, remembering to

> Always take into consideration the fact that you might be dead wrong

but it went pretty well. I was in top 3 players of the episode, losing after being eliminated by the winner.

Here comes the recording. I didn't upload it to youtube, because they remove copyrighted content :(

# My questions

I was asked for the following things:


### Stage 1
Q: Was [Ondraszek](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondraszek) a real person?  
A: Yes

Q: What suits are of red color in cards?  
A: Karo (Diamonds) and Kier (Hearts) - in Poland we use French names

### Stage 2
Q: Which epoch was directly following the Iron age?  
A: Bronze

Q: In which state of USA Mamutowiec Olbrzymi (Giant Redwood) grows naturally?  
A: California

Q: Do Walruses live in Arctica?  
A: Yes

Q: Ingrid Bergman and Ingmar Bergman - did they have the same nationality?  
A: Yes, Swedish. (I failed. No idea why I didn't remember that and had suspicion that Ingmar could be Danish)

Q: Whose last name is mentioned in <i>manouver</i> of first aid in case of choking?  
A: Heimlich's Manouver (I didn't know the answer)

Q: What does English name "Fox Trot" mean exactly in Polish?  
A: I've said 'Lisi chód' (literally: walk of the fox), which wasn't the expected answer but it was accepted

### Stage 3 - Final

Q: The highest number in decimal system using two different digits.  
A: 98

Q: What word is used in Polish translation of the Copernicus' work - (Celestial) Object, Sphere, Planete?  
A: Sphere (I still feel ashamed my answer was wrong. I've said Object. It's impossible to correctly translate this question)

Q: To which sea does Luxembourg have access?  
A: It's land-locked

Q: Biała Podlaska, Bielsk Podlaski, Sokołów Podlaski - which town is the one located in Podlaskie voivodeship?  
A: Bielsk Podlaski (hard, but the map from Hearts of Iron II helped me a bit)

![Poland in 1936 as depicted in Hearts of Iron II](/images/jeden-z-dziesieciu/bielsk.png)
<p style="text-align:center">I had about 3 seconds to recall that Bielsk on HoI II map  
was next to Białystok - a capital of Podlaskie ;)</p>

Q: Thrombocytes - which tissue are they part of?  
A: Connective tissue (The more precise answer would be: fluid connective tissue, also known as blood)

Q: On which American Battleship Japan has signed surrender in 1945?  
A: USS Missouri (I gave no answer)

Q: Question about two polish names of far-sightedness. This question is not translatable into English.  
A: My answer was correct.

Q: Give at least one of the three first names of Casanova.  
A: Giovanni Giacomo Girolamo (My answer was French 'Jean' which is John, just as Italian 'Giovanni', so if I said it in Polish then it would most likely be accepted. But anyway it looks like the 'Giovanni' was an oversight in the answer prepared by the staff of the quiz, as Wikipedia in many languages mentions just 2 first names of Casanova, and Giovanni is name of his brother)

# What next?

I'll be able to play again in four years.
