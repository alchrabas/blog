Summary: The video from my appearance in the Grand Final of 'Jeden z Dziesięciu' - Polish quiz show

In [my previous post]({filename}jeden-z-dziesieciu-vol2.md) I wrote about my victory in TV show 'Jeden z Dziesięciu'.
I've mentioned then that the top 10 winners of the season participate in the Grand Final. I've just managed to get into the final as the tenth, but it didn't really matter, as all the players have the equal chances.



# The rules of the Grand Final

They are really the same as in a regular episode, the difference is only when it goes to the prizes for the winners, which are significantly higher:

 - 40 000 PLN goes to the winner of the final
 - 10 000 PLN goes to the player who gets the most points combined from the regular episode and the grand final

Also, the questions are generally harder.

# Preparation

When I went to the railway station just before my train was planned to depart, I've noticed that I forgot to take the suit. I knew the shops will be closed in Lublin when I'll arrive there, so for a moment I was very worried that I'll have to visit Tadeusz Sznuk in the T-Shirt.

But, thanks to PKP, the train was delayed and I managed to quickly buy some semi-elegant shirt in the nearby shop. So, a bit calmer, I rode to Lublin.

My plan was to not lose after the first two questions and, if I'll be very lucky, to get to the final.

The recording was just a few days before Russian invasion on Ukraine, which is not that far from Lublin.

# The game

The first round was easy, but the second was pretty hard. People were aware that player number 2 is very strong and got a lot of points in his episode, but nobody could feel safe. I was pretty good for most of the round, but then I made two mistakes and I was pretty unsure if I'll do it.

The final was pretty surprising, with a few plot twists. You can watch the course of action in the video below. In general, I was very happy, even though it could've been even better.

# Video

Below I've reuploaded the recording, so it won't disappear.

# Aftermath

It was better than I've expected and I was even close to winning, which would be absolutely great. In general it was a nice experience. I'll try again in four years.

I've asked Tadeusz Sznuk for the autograph, but he said he's forbidden to make any contact with the players because of COVID restrictions ;( so I've promised I'll be back to take it in four years. Then I've taken the cup I won in the grand final and good memories to Kraków.
