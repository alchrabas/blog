title: About me
save_as: about.html

My name is Aleksander Chrabąszcz and I'm living in Kraków, Poland. Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer in Guidewire Software.

When it goes to programming I'm mostly tied to JVM. Among others, I know Java, Python, ES6, CSS, Scala, PHP, Gosu, SQL (especially MySQL, also Postgres + PostGIS). I also use AWS for cloud services and I've used Terraform to provision them.

I like recreational cycling and producing home beverages: nalewkas, cider, wine. More about that topic (in Polish) can be found on my site [alkowadomowa.pl](https://alkowadomowa.pl).

I'm working on my browser game called Exeris, which is a perpetual activity that may never be finished - more about it can be read on [blog.exeris.org](https://blog.exeris.org).

My other interests include foreign languages and history. Another, a more passive activity is watching sport, especially football (soccer) and ski jumping.

Natural languages I know best are Polish and English. I also know some German, Esperanto, Italian and I'm trying to study Latin for reading.  
If you are also interested in languages, you can [follow me on Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/alchrabas).
