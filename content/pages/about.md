title: About me
save_as: about.html

My name is Aleksander Chrabąszcz and I'm living in Kraków, Poland. Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer in Guidewire Software.

When it goes to programming I'm mostly tied to JVM. Among others, I know Java, Python, ES6, CSS, Scala, PHP, Gosu, SQL (especially MySQL, also Postgres + PostGIS).

My other interests include foreign languages and history. Another, a more passive activity is watching sport, especially football (soccer) and ski jumping.

Natural languages I know best are Polish and English. I also know some German, Esperanto, I'm learning Italian and unsuccessfully trying to study Latin, but the latter only for reading, so don't try to speak to me. ;)  
If you are also interested in languages, then you can follow me on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/alchrabas).
