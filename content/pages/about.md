title: About me
save_as: about.html

My name is Aleksander Chrabąszcz and I'm living in Kraków, Poland. Currently I'm working as a Software Engineer in Guidewire Software.

When it goes to programming I'm mostly tied to JVM. Among others, I know Java, Python, ES6, CSS, Scala, PHP, Gosu, SQL (especially MySQL, also Postgres + PostGIS).

My other interests include foreign languages and history.

Natural languages I know best are Polish and English. I also know German, Esperanto and a bit of Latin, but the latter only for reading, so don't try to talk with me as I'll be pretty embarassed. ;)
