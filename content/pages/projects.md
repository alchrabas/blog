Some of my projects:

1. Cantr - for 6 years being a programmer working on upgrading the code, planning and introducing new features for a browser-based society simulator and role-playing game. Mostly PHP, JS and MySQL. Also for about 4 years I was part of the Game Administration
2. Pyslate - a powerful library for handling i18n in Python applications. Makes it easy to introduce variants for fusional languages and extensively uses fallbacks
3. Exeris - a browser-based crafting and exploration game. Backend in Python and SQLAlchemy, frontend in ES6 + React
4. Bestaro - A library that helps in finding lost pets. Scala, ES6 + React

Most of these are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/alchrabas).
