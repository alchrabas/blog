Some of my projects:

1. Cantr - for 8 years being a programmer working on upgrading the code, planning and introducing new features for a browser-based society simulator and role-playing game. Mostly PHP, JS and MySQL. Also for about 4 years I was part of the Game Administration
2. Pyslate - a powerful library for handling i18n in Python applications. Makes it easy to introduce variants for fusional languages and extensively uses fallbacks - [GitHub](https://github.com/alchrabas/pyslate)
3. Exeris - a browser-based crafting and exploration game. Backend in Python and SQLAlchemy, frontend in ES6 + React - [blog.exeris.org](https://blog.exeris.org) 
4. MapaZwierzat.pl - A site (and library called Bestaro) that helps in finding lost pets. Scala, ES6 + React - [mapazwierzat.pl](https://mapazwierzat.pl)

Most of these are available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/alchrabas).
