Some of my projects:

1. Cantr - for 5 years being a programmer working on upgrading the code, planning and introducing new features for a browser-based society simulator and role-playing game. Mostly PHP, JS and MySQL
2. Pyslate - a powerful library for handling i18n of Python applications. Makes it easy to introduce variants for fusional languages and uses fallbacks extensively
3. Exeris - a browser-based crafting and exploration game. Backend in Python and SQLAlchemy, frontend in ES6 + React
4. Bestaro - A library that helps in finding lost pets. Scala, ES6 + React

Most of these are available on <a href="https://github.com/alchrabas">GitHub</a>.
