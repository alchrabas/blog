Summary: Reference to my Exeris blog post about procedural world map generation

A year ago I worked on an algorithm for procedural world generation in my game [Exeris](https://blog.exeris.org). I admit engagement in this project had its ups and downs. I've worked just a little on Exeris since then, but I find it such an interesting program on its own. For that reason I've decided to link to my article on the game development blog.

It can be read here: [blog.exeris.org/world-map-generation](https://blog.exeris.org/world-map-generation.html).

An example of the randomly generated map can be seen below.
