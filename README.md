This repository contains the source code of my Pelican blog which is available on [https://chrabasz.cz](https://chrabasz.cz).

The sources from this repository are built in AWS Lambda and served as a static site from an S3 bucket. The source code is available in [build-pelican-in-lambda](https://github.com/alchrabas/build-pelican-in-aws-lambda) repository on GitHub.

I've written how it's done in [this blog post](https://chrabasz.cz/build-pelican-in-lambda.html).
